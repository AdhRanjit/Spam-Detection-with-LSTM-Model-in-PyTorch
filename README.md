# Spam-Detection-with-LSTM-Model-in-PyTorch
This project aims to build a spam detection system using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to classify text messages as either spam or not spam. The model is implemented using PyTorch, and the text data is preprocessed with scikit-learn and NLTK for tokenization and stopword removal.
